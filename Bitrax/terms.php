                        		Even though local, international stocks, FX, or CFD trading can be profitable, it is associated with high risk of losing your investment. The risk will increase when trading on margin carriers. Clients must impose due diligence and be careful when taking their trading decisions. It is the sole responsibility of the client to learn and gain the knowledge and experience required to use the trading platform and whatever would be needed to trade properly. Clients must know that the risks of trading may sometimes overcome the whole capital invested. Clients must also know that knowledge and experience do not necessitate making profits since the markets can be affected by other unexpected factors that may lead to clients’ losses such as economic and/or political crises. In all cases, we will not be held liable for any trading decisions, violation of the applicable legal rules and/or regulations, and lack of knowledge and/or experience referred to the client.
